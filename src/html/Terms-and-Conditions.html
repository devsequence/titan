							The subscription is recurring, as indicated when you buy it. However, you can cancel it whenever you want in your customer area of the website or by sending us an email to support@titantrade.com at least one week before the renewal. The subscription money will not be returned in any case if it is due to negligence of the client and he has not worried about cancelling it on time. In the same way, pursuant to article 103 of Law 3/2014 of 27 March, the transactions covered by these terms and conditions are excluded from the right of withdrawal, and therefore constitutes one of the exceptions to the right of reimbursement once the service has been granted and enjoyment of the service has commenced.
